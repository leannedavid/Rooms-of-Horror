## Backstory
```
You are Taomei who woke up in a room that seems familiar but does not seem to ring any bell. Looking around, you don't see anyone nearby to help you in your predicament at the moment. For some reason, you feel uncomfortable staying any longer where you are and want to get out. However, the door does not seem to open. The only way to get out is playing with the white maltese puppy named Candy in a series of room puzzles. She gives you hints but you are all on your own to answer her riddles. Giving the wrong answer may cost you your life....
```

### Goals

Your goal as Taomei is to escape the room as quick as possible. You may not know it, but time is ticking and every second you waste brings you closer to death. Listen to Candy on her riddles and make sure you inspect EVERYTHING. You may never know if you missed a spot or not until it is already too late.
